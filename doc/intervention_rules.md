# Intervention Rules & Mentoring Strategy

## Objective

Define structured mentoring interventions based on ML-derived student clusters. These rules translate analytical insights into actionable mentoring workflows.

- Long-term planning
- Skill alignment with industry roles
- Preventive wellness guidance

#### Intervention Strategy
- Monthly structured mentoring session
- Career mapping exercises
- Internship readiness review
- Skill gap assessment

#### Monitoring Intensity
Low to Moderate

## Escalation Logic

- **If a student remains Red for:**
  - 2 consecutive review cycles → escalate to senior mentor
  - 3 cycles → initiate structured intervention plan

- **If a student improves cluster assignment:**
  - Downgrade monitoring intensity gradually

## Integration with Rule-Based SRI

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| SRI | Provides urgency level |
| Clustering | Provides root-cause diagnosis |

**Intervention decisions prioritize cluster identity first, SRI second.**
